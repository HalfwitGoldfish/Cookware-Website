## Comments

### Desktop version

- Navigation is incomplete
  -When you hover over one button the prior supposed to darken
-Footer subscribe button has a hover effect.
  -I don't believe there should be one
-Footer is missing hover effect over the list.
  -There is a green accent hover effect that needs to be there
-Sale on the navigation has a hover effect, but yours seem to be only turning the text black

### Responsiveness

-I noticed that the "Reviews" text would begin overtaking the image instead of shrinking down alongside the image

### Overall

This is amazing work! Good job. I am impressed, awestruck, and jealous of how responsive you made it.
If you finish the little things I mentioned then I think you can get a hundred on the assignment if not very close.
